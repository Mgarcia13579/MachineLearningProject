Loan Prediction Model Report

Topic Research

This projectâ€™s objective is to create a Loan prediction model that takes multiple variables and determines whether 
an individual will be granted a loan. Potential applications for this project are banks that are interested in using a model to determine the eligibility of a loan candidate or small companies that give personal loans can also use this model for the same reason. Some known challenges for building or implementing my model are data preparation and data cleaning. To clarify, it is important to have good data preparation so that the model can accurately weigh all the parameters. In addition, data cleaning is extremely important because missing data in the training set can give the model a bias toward a parameter that will cause the model to not give accurate predictions. Based on my research, the types of datasets that have been used in the past for loan prediction models are Categorical Datasets. These categorical Datasets represent features or characteristics of a person or an object. In this case it would be several characteristics of the individual applying for a loan such as applicant income or loan size. In the past the most common methods that were applied to loan prediction models were SVM, XGBoost, and random forest. In addition, it appears random forest and XGBoost are the best methods for accomplishing the loan prediction task. These two methods alternate on being the best depending on the quality of the dataset used during the training phase. The most common metric that is used to measure model success for the loan prediction task is accuracy.
